  <h1>My Diary - 1998</h1>
  <div class="content">
Hello friends, how are you? Today was a great day for me. I got a job at a delivery company today, and I really enjoyed working there.

Anyway, I also wanted to share a development in my personal life that I am currently going through. I just moved to another city to be able to go to this job because the city I used to live in was too far from my workplace.

Also, on the day I arrived at my job, for some reason they gave me a paper with symbols, one that looked like a duck, another an apple, another a piece of chalk, and the last one a folder. I don't know what it was for, but I completely set it aside because I didn't really understand what it meant since I wasn’t given any information about this paper.

Anyway, I continued working there even with that strange paper. Could it be something I should show to my boss? I have no idea, but someday I will find out what to do with this paper.

Today I also found a strange channel that has a strange content on it, some kind of crazy music like that, but I didn’t pay much attention because I don’t get scared easily. But how the hell did I find that?? It was a really strange experience, so to speak. It wasn’t fear, but rather, doubt.
