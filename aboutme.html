      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a music composer and a game maker, most people call me by <strong>Avernos</strong> or <strong>Winter</strong>.
        Also check out my SoundCloud which I am starting right now!

      <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <p>
        Well, I really like some series like <strong>Murder Drones</strong> or <strong>Breaking Bad</strong> and some others.
        I also like listening a lot to <strong>Killswitch Engage</strong> and <strong>Mastodon</strong>, and even <strong>Black Sabbath</strong>.
        And I love pistachio ice cream... why did I even say that? 😀

      <h2>My Work Time</h2>
      <p>
        If I am pretty sure, I worked in music for like 2 or 3 years if I remember.
        And yes, I am still learning <strong>FL Studio</strong> even with that much time on it,
        but I have been recently thinking about putting more and more effort into my works!

      <h2>My Projects</h2>
      <p>
        I do have quite a lot of projects on Roblox, some have failed, some I am still working on,
        but I think the best ones yet are <strong>Nevanova</strong> and <strong>Elevators</strong>.  
        Nevanova is a war game, and Elevators is a <strong>Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion</strong>-like game, which I also love!  
        And I will talk about my game interests right now.

      <h2>My Game Interests</h2>
      <p>
        My game interests are simple. I like playing <strong>Zelda</strong>, <strong>Super Mario</strong>, and some <strong>SNES</strong> games.  
        I am starting to play <strong>Metroid</strong> and <strong>Megaman</strong>.  
        Some of the games I play more are <strong>Roblox</strong>.  
        One of the best games I’ve played was totally <strong>The Multi-Medium</strong> — that one with the spacesuit guy who travels through universes —  
        and I also got inspired by it when I made <strong>Elevators</strong>!  
        And of course, the classic <strong>Undertale</strong>, a really well-developed game.  
        I await for <strong>Deltarune Chapter 5</strong>... Toby Fox, I await... 💀

      <h2>What I Can Work With</h2>
      <p>
        Well, I usually don’t ask for any money to make music for games or projects,  
        but I do want to help my parents, so I’m accepting any job for money.  
        Just gotta say I also have to study — and if that’s a problem for you, please don’t even mind me.
