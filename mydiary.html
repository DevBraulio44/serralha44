Actually that must be some sort of puzzle game and not just rpg dont you think??? i dont know!! how will it be i am so curious about it 0_0. well and my friend told me to watch the video after, but what video?? he didnt mention it, i think its like the trailer or something, or maybe rule 34 LMAO, jk i dont really know what it is but we can find it out right lads?, it cant be that bad for a rpg game that i dont even know if anybody played it yet, but i think i will like it a lot and maybe get some secret stuff!!!</p>
